# Text-Mining

The data is a collection of documents (text/pdf files) contained in the "msc-plagiarism-assigment" folder.

### The Assignment is divided into 3 parts :
a)Normalize the text and create a similarity matrix using Jaccard index.
  Apply hierarchical
  clustering. Cut the dendrogram at k and identify clusters of similar documents.

b)Create Tf-idf matrix of the collection.
  Using Cosine distance, create a similarity matrix.
  Cluster the documents using K means clustering, and find the number of clusters (k) that minimizes SSE.
  Apply hierarchical clustering. Cut the dendrogram at k and identify clusters of similar documents

c)Perform LSA using reduced latent space with 4 dimensions.
  For each topic identify the set of 5 top weighted terms.
  Find the similarity matrix for the documents in the reduced space.
  Apply hierarchical clustering. Cut the dendrogram at k and identify clusters of similar documents.
